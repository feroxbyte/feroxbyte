Hey, I'm Batuhan — a software engineer based in Istanbul, Turkey.

I build web applications with a focus on clean architecture and great user experiences. Started my journey in 2022 with Angular, spent two solid years there, then made the switch to SvelteKit and never looked back. These days I'm mostly crafting dashboards and SaaS products.

### what I work with

**Frontend** — SvelteKit is my home. TypeScript everywhere.

**Backend** — Node.js with Hono or Express. Some Spring when Java calls.

**Data** — PostgreSQL.

**Infrastructure** — Docker, Cloudflare, self-hosted deployments.

### what I'm exploring

Design systems — how to build and scale them properly.
